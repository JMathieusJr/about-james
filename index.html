    <h1>About James</h1>
    <p>My full name is James Lee Mathieus Jr. I am going to be telling the story of the linage of my last name.
        I think it's definitely a story worth telling.
        I was named after my father James Lee Mathieus senior. His fathers name is Edward Mathieus (my Grandfather).
        My Grandfather is actually the first Mathieus born with the name.
        The story I was told is that his mother had an affair with a married man.
        This mans last name was spelled Mathewes but to protect him and still keep the name similar she just changed the spelling at the end.
        Unfortunately I wont be able to find out the truth behind my name because my Grandmother passed away without telling anyone the whole story behind the name.
        My son Brandon X. Mathieus is now the next in line to carry the name.
