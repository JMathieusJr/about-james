    <h1>About James</h1>
    <p>My full name is James Lee Mathieus Jr. I am orginally from the United States and came to New Mexico accidently. I was traveling from Massacusetts to New York and must have made a wrong turn and ended up here. At first I was worried because I didn't have a passport but it doesn't seem to be a problem. I was also pleased to learn that I could use American dollars here without any trouble. The weather here is nice and the people are friendly so I've decided to stay for a while.

        I am currently working as a tattoo artist but I haven't had much work in the a while so I decided to change careers and Web Site Developer seemed to be a good choice where I can do technical work and still explore my artistic talents. If anyone at the bootcamp wants a tattoo, I'm always available and I will give you a discount.
